- [<span style="color:red">Synthetic Intelligence</span>](https://github.com/Unlimited-Research-Cooperative/Human-Brain-Rat)
  bio silicon synergetic learning systems, we are prototyping our own BCI and MEA, currently working on fpga code and designing a pressurized biosafety cabinet with pass through

- [<span style="color:red">EEG prediction using chaos theory, and a CNN Kuramoto transformer RNN github</span>](https://github.com/Metaverse-Crowdsource/EEG-tES-Chaos-Neural-Net)
  signal analysis and prediction of brain signals, can be modified for other types of signals as well, also made pipy libraries from the experiments
  
- [<span style="color:red">Dark Flow, our cyberpunk MMORPG project at Metaverse Crowdsource</span>](https://discord.gg/HBHGvDxDmt)
  opensource, FPS/TPS MMORPG with realistic graphics, deep philosophy, fast action, abiding by no regulations on content
  
- [<span style="color:red">Bacteria neural network project starting soon on github</span>](https://github.com/Metaverse-Crowdsource/Bacteria-Neural-Network)
  using bacteria as a neural network
  
- [<span style="color:red">Player Two our custom no-rules AI chat at Neocadia Labs</span>](https://discord.gg/r2qUZMkGCB)

for collaborations, press, questions, email me soul.syrupp@gmail.com or dm me on discord ( soul_syrup ) or tiktok ( soul.syrup )

please test these and let me know if there are any problems, I'll put them in a library for human cortical organoid/spheroid, EEG, ECoG, and other signal analysis needs, once they're verified to be working fine
